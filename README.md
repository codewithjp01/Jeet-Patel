🖨️ 3D Printer Error Detection System
AI-powered fault detection for 3D printing operations using accelerometer sensor data.

📌 Overview
This is a Flask-based web application designed to detect faults or anomalies in 3D printer operation by analyzing real-time 3-axis accelerometer data (X, Y, Z).

The system uses a Logistic Regression model trained on data from the ADXL345 sensor. It predicts whether the printer is operating normally or if a fault is present — achieving a training accuracy of 88.5%.

✨ Features
🔹 Real-time Fault Detection from live accelerometer input
🔹 Interactive Web Interface built with HTML/CSS

📊 Model Performance
Best Model: Logistic Regression
Accuracy: 88.48% on test data
Input: X, Y, Z values from ADXL345
Output: Binary classification – “Yes” (error), “No” (no error)

⚠️ Limitations
The dataset is imbalanced, with more "YES" (error) labels than "NO", which may affect prediction accuracy for rare cases.
Further generalization requires more balanced or real-time data from diverse printer scenarios.
